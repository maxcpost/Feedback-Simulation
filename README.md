# Audio Feedback Simulator

## Overview
The Audio Feedback Simulator is an interactive web application designed to help audio engineers, event technicians, and students understand and visualize potential feedback scenarios in audio setups. This tool provides real-time visualization of speaker coverage patterns and microphone pickup patterns, helping users learn how to prevent audio feedback in live sound environments.

## Features
- **Interactive Simulation**: Drag-and-drop interface for positioning speakers and microphones
- **Real-time Feedback Detection**: Visual indication of potential feedback areas
- **Multiple Microphone Types**:
  - Cardioid
  - Supercardioid
  - Hypercardioid
  - Omnidirectional
- **Adjustable Parameters**:
  - Speaker volume with visual pattern scaling
  - Microphone rotation (0-360 degrees)
  - Speaker rotation (0-360 degrees)
  - Multiple speaker support
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Green pattern for speaker coverage
  - Blue pattern for microphone pickup
  - Red highlighting for potential feedback areas

## How to Use
1. **Setup**:
   - Add speakers using the "Add Speaker" button
   - Position speakers by dragging them
   - Select desired microphone type
   - Position microphone by dragging

2. **Adjustments**:
   - Use slider controls to adjust speaker volume
   - Rotate speakers and microphone using angle controls
   - Observe pattern changes in real-time

3. **Feedback Detection**:
   - Red areas indicate potential feedback zones
   - Click "Check Setup" to analyze the current configuration
   - Receive immediate feedback about the setup's safety
